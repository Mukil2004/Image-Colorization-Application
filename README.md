<h1>Image Colorization Application</h1>
The Image Colorization Application is a user-friendly tool that uses AI to transform grayscale and negative images into naturally colorized visuals. This project leverages deep learning models to bring old photographs, negatives, or monochrome images to life with vibrant and realistic colors.

<h3>Features</h3>

‚Ä¢üñºÔ∏è Grayscale Image Colorization: Automatically add realistic colors to grayscale images.

‚Ä¢	üîÑ Negative Image Conversion: Detects and converts negative images to positive before applying colorization.

‚Ä¢	üé® Enhanced Image Quality: Fine-tuned output with brightness, contrast, and saturation enhancements.

‚Ä¢	üíª Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for seamless uploads and real-time processing.

‚Ä¢	üì• Downloadable Output: Save the colorized image for further use or sharing.

<h3>How It Works</h3>

‚Ä¢	Upload: Select a grayscale or negative image in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png format.

‚Ä¢	Processing:

1. Grayscale images: Sent directly for colorization using the pre-trained model.

2.	Negative images: Converted to positive format and then colorized.

‚Ä¢	Enhancement: Brightness, contrast, and saturation are optimized for the final output.

‚Ä¢	Output: View and download the colorized image.
